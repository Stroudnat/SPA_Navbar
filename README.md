# SPA_Navbar

# instructions:
This is a very simple navbar that takes controle of single page applications. this allows not only one to simplify their code tremendously by allowing you to render HTML documents within a root div, thus not having to recreate things such as navagation bars. Here i use place holder text and bootstrap to mimic an actual application one might might be responsibloe for making. Click around and go through each page as it renders a new page without having to reload the page.

# Roadmap to Future:
In future endevours I would love to not only make a react version of this application but to add more capabilities to include a search option within the pages if you wanted to type it in or click to find the correct page. This can be done by adding an onsubmit attribute to the search input within the HTML doc and link a function to it turning the string entered into a hash that can be enterd for browsing. Time has ommited this function so hopefully i will update this function in the vary near future.
